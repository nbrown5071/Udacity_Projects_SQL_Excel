### Project Description 
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is an American stock exchange in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City. The project was divided into several portions; data cleaning and exploration, Financial Modeling, Forecasting, and Presentation/ Visualization. In this project, I went through the process of calculating summary statistics, drawing any inferences from the statistics, calculating business metrics, and using models to forecast future growth prospects for the companies. The goal is to perform an analysis and also create visual tools to communicate the results in informative ways.

### About the Data
The project utilized real life data from the NYSE. The data was received from the Udacity learning platform. It is a smaller subset of data drawn from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse).  For the project, we were provided one .csv file containing the data from the NYSE. 

### Process & Skills 
After converting the .csv file to Excel, I first created a tab with the project objectives and instructions. I proceeded with cleaning and manipulating the data. I calculated measures of central tendancy and performed explorartory analysis with pivot tables. I then created two tabs for the forecasting and financial modeling deliverables. I designed then and used the data along with the appropriate formulas to complete them. Lastly, I created a project presentation slide based on my exploratory analysis of the data. To ensure design and calculation correctness, Udacity provided some simple questions to test the Forecasting and Financial Modeling portions of the project. For example: What is the Operating Income reported by EBAY in 2014? "2,476,000,000"

- Interpreting measures of central tendency and spread (mean, median, standard deviation, range).
- Utilizing a combination of Excel or Google Sheets functions (e.g., IF statements, INDEX, MATCH, OFFSET, VLOOKUP, calculating descriptive statistics, dropdowns, data validation).
- Analyzing and forecasting financial business metrics using Excel or Google Sheets.
- Creating visualizations of a business metric and utilizing Excel or Google Sheets.

### Findings
•	The Electric utilities category is the most profitable among the utilities sector.

•	The Multi utilities categoryof the utilities sector is has the lowest risk investment based on standard deviation. 

•	DUK, a sub-industry of the Electric utilities category, has the most stable growth margin and operating margin. 



### Reflection
This project was very challenging. It required a lot of design and data thinking in order to present the deliverables. I am very proud of this project. The interative sheets are my favorite part. 

### Reviewer’s Comments
Reviewer Note
Excellent work in your use of INDEX and MATCH statements. It helped you in creating a dynamic dashboard for the Profit and loss statement and Forecasting.
